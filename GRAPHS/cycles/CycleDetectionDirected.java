/**
 * Cycle Detection in Directed Graphs - Multiple Implementations
 * 
 * A cycle in a directed graph is a path of length â‰¥ 1 that starts and ends
 * at the same vertex, following the direction of edges.
 * 
 * Key Properties:
 * - Back edge in DFS tree indicates cycle
 * - Topological sorting fails if and only if cycles exist
 * - Can detect self-loops (cycles of length 1)
 * - White-Gray-Black coloring helps track DFS states
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(V + E) for all approaches
 * Space Complexity: O(V)
 * 
 * Common MAANG Applications:
 * - Deadlock detection in systems
 * - Dependency cycle detection (build systems, imports)
 * - Task scheduling validation
 * - Compiler optimization (loop detection)
 * - Process dependency analysis
 * - Course prerequisite validation

     *

     * Algorithm:
     * 1. Maintain visited array and current path array

     * 3. If we encounter a vertex that's currently on the path, cycle found
