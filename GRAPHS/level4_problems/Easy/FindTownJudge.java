 * LeetCode 997: Find the Town Judge
 * 
 * Problem: In a town, there are n people labeled from 1 to n. There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly
 * the town judge. If the town judge exists, then:
 * 1. The town judge trusts nobody.
 * 2. Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
 * 3. There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(E) where E is number of trust relationships
 * Space Complexity: O(n)
