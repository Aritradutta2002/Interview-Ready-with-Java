## Key Concepts to Master
- BST Properties and Validation
- Inorder Traversal (gives sorted order)
- BST Search, Insert, Delete operations
- Range queries and successor/predecessor
- Space-optimized iterators
- BST construction from sorted arrays

## Study Tips
1. Always remember: Inorder traversal of BST gives sorted sequence
2. Practice both recursive and iterative approaches
3. Understand the three cases of node deletion
4. Master range validation techniques
5. Learn to use BST property to optimize search operations

## Time Complexity Reference
- Search: O(h) where h is height, O(log n) for balanced BST
- Insert: O(h)
- Delete: O(h)
- Inorder Traversal: O(n)
