/**
 * BEST TIME TO BUY AND SELL STOCK - Leetcode 121
 * Difficulty: Easy
 * Companies: Amazon, Microsoft, Bloomberg, Facebook, Google, Apple, Uber
 * 
 * PROBLEM:
 * You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
 * You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing 
 * a different day in the future to sell that stock.
 * Return the maximum profit you can achieve. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.
 * 
 * CONSTRAINTS:
 * - You can complete at most ONE transaction
 * - You must buy before you sell
 * 
 * EXAMPLES:
 * Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
 * 
 * Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: No transaction is done and the max profit = 0.
 * 
 * PATTERN: One-pass tracking
 * KEY INSIGHT: Track minimum price so far and maximum profit

/**
 * ========== KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR INTERVIEWS ==========
 * 
 * 1. THIS IS THE FOUNDATION PROBLEM:
 *    - Must solve this before attempting Stock II, III, IV
 *    - Teaches fundamental concept of tracking state
 *    - Very common in phone screens
 * 
 * 2. KEY INSIGHT:
 *    - To maximize profit = maximize (sell price - buy price)
 *    - This means buy at minimum and sell at maximum AFTER that minimum
 *    - Track minimum price so far and calculate potential profit at each step
 * 
 * 3. WHY GREEDY WORKS HERE:
 *    - We want the global minimum as buy price
 *    - And any future price as sell price
 *    - Single pass is sufficient
 * 
 * 4. CONNECTION TO KADANE'S ALGORITHM:
 *    - Transform to daily profit array
 *    - Find maximum subarray sum
 *    - This insight helps with harder stock problems
 * 
 * 5. STATE MACHINE APPROACH:
 *    - 2 states: own stock, don't own stock
 *    - Transitions: buy (not own → own), sell (own → not own)
 *    - This generalizes to all stock problems!
 * 
 * 6. FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS:
 *    - Unlimited transactions? → Stock II (Leetcode 122)
 *    - At most 2 transactions? → Stock III (Leetcode 123)
 *    - At most k transactions? → Stock IV (Leetcode 188)
 *    - With cooldown? → Stock with Cooldown (Leetcode 309)
 *    - With transaction fee? → Stock with Fee (Leetcode 714)
 * 
 * 7. RELATED PROBLEMS:
 *    - Leetcode 121: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock (this)
 *    - Leetcode 122: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II
 *    - Leetcode 123: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III
 *    - Leetcode 188: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV
 *    - Leetcode 309: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Cooldown
 *    - Leetcode 714: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee
 * 
 * 8. INTERVIEW STRATEGY:
 *    - Start with brute force (show you understand problem)
 *    - Explain the insight about tracking minimum
 *    - Code the one-pass solution
 *    - Explain time and space complexity
 *    - Mention state machine for generalization
 * 
 * 9. COMMON MISTAKES:
 *    - Trying to track both buy and sell indices (not needed!)
 *    - Selling before buying (check order in nested loops)
 *    - Not initializing minPrice properly
 *    - Overthinking the problem
 * 
 * 10. COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS:
 *     - Time: O(n) - Single pass through array
 *     - Space: O(1) - Only using 2 variables
 *     - This is optimal! Can't do better.
