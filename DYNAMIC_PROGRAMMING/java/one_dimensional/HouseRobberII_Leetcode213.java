 * HOUSE ROBBER II - Leetcode 213
 * Difficulty: Medium
 * Companies: Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Google, Facebook
 * 
 * PROBLEM:
 * Similar to House Robber I, but houses are arranged in a CIRCLE.
 * This means the FIRST and LAST houses are adjacent.
 * You cannot rob both the first and last house.
 * 
 * EXAMPLES:
 * Input: nums = [2,3,2]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money=2) and house 3 (money=2) together, they're adjacent.
 * 
 * Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: Rob house 1 (money=1) and house 3 (money=3). Total = 4.
 * 
 * PATTERN: House Robber I + Constraint Handling
 * KEY INSIGHT: If houses form a circle, we have 2 scenarios:
 * 1. Rob houses from 0 to n-2 (exclude last house)
 * 2. Rob houses from 1 to n-1 (exclude first house)
 * Answer = max of these two scenarios

    // ========== MAIN SOLUTION ⭐ RECOMMENDED ==========
    // Time: O(n) - Two passes of O(n)
    // Space: O(1) - Constant space for each pass
    /**
     * BEGINNER'S EXPLANATION:
     * Since first and last are neighbors in a circle, we can't rob both.
     * So we split into 2 cases:
     * 
     * Case 1: Exclude last house
     *    Houses: [0, 1, 2, ..., n-2]  ← Regular House Robber I
     * 
     * Case 2: Exclude first house
     *    Houses: [1, 2, 3, ..., n-1]  ← Regular House Robber I
     * 
     * Visualization for [2,3,2]:
     *        2
     *       / \
     *      3   2  ← These are neighbors!
     * 
     * Case 1: Rob [2,3]     → max = 3
     * Case 2: Rob [3,2]     → max = 3
     * Final answer: max(3,3) = 3

    // ========== STEP-BY-STEP EXPLANATION ==========
    /**
     * Let's trace through example: [2,3,2]
     * 
     * Houses arranged in circle:
     *      [2] --- [3]
     *       \     /
     *        [2]
     * 
     * Step 1: Identify the constraint
     * - First (index 0) and Last (index 2) are neighbors
     * - Can't rob both
     * 
     * Step 2: Split into 2 scenarios
     * Scenario A: Rob from index 0 to n-2 (exclude last)
     *   Array: [2, 3]
     *   Max: 3 (rob house with 3)
     * 
     * Scenario B: Rob from index 1 to n-1 (exclude first)
     *   Array: [3, 2]
     *   Max: 3 (rob house with 3)
     * 
     * Step 3: Take maximum
     * Answer: max(3, 3) = 3
     * 
     * 
     * Another example: [1,2,3,1]
     * 
     * Houses arranged in circle:
     *      [1] --- [2]
     *       |       |
     *      [1] --- [3]
     * 
     * Scenario A: Rob [1,2,3] (exclude last 1)
     *   DP: [1, 2, 4]
     *   Max: 4 (rob 1 and 3)
     * 
     * Scenario B: Rob [2,3,1] (exclude first 1)
     *   DP: [2, 3, 3]
     *   Max: 3 (rob 2 or 3)
     * 
     * Answer: max(4, 3) = 4

/**
 * ========== KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR INTERVIEWS ==========
 * 
 * 1. CIRCULAR CONSTRAINT HANDLING:
 *    - When array is circular and first/last are neighbors
 *    - Strategy: Split into 2 linear subproblems
 *    - Common pattern in circular array problems
 * 
 * 2. PROBLEM REDUCTION:
 *    - Reduce complex problem to simpler known problem
 *    - House Robber II → Two instances of House Robber I
 *    - Shows strong problem-solving skills in interviews!
 * 
 * 3. EDGE CASES TO MENTION:
 *    - Empty array
 *    - Single house (no circle constraint)
 *    - Two houses (just pick max)
 * 
 * 4. FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS:
 *    - Houses in a tree structure? → House Robber III (Leetcode 337)
 *    - Can rob k houses apart? → Modify the robLinear function
 *    - Multiple circles? → Apply same split strategy
 * 
 * 5. INTERVIEW STRATEGY:
 *    Step 1: Recognize it's House Robber with constraint
 *    Step 2: Identify the circular constraint
 *    Step 3: Propose splitting strategy
 *    Step 4: Implement robLinear helper
 *    Step 5: Combine results with max()
 * 
 * 6. COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS:
 *    - Time: O(n) - Two passes through array
 *    - Space: O(1) - Only using variables
 *    - Better than O(n) space of DP array
 * 
 * 7. RELATED PROBLEMS:
 *    - Leetcode 198: House Robber (prerequisite)
 *    - Leetcode 337: House Robber III (tree version)
 *    - Leetcode 740: Delete and Earn
 *    - Leetcode 213: This problem!
 * 
 * 8. COMMON MISTAKES:
 *    - Forgetting to handle edge case n=2
 *    - Incorrect range for start and end indices
 *    - Not recognizing this reduces to House Robber I
 *    - Trying to solve with complex circular DP (overcomplicating)
 * 
 * 9. WHY THIS APPROACH WORKS:
 *    - If we rob first house, we CANNOT rob last
 *      → So consider range [0, n-2]
 *    - If we rob last house, we CANNOT rob first
 *      → So consider range [1, n-1]
 *    - If we rob neither first nor last
 *      → This case is included in both scenarios above!
 *    - Taking max of both covers all possibilities
