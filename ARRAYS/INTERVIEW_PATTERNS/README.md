## 🎓 How to Use This Guide

### For Beginners:
1. Start with **Two Sum** (easiest)
2. Move to **Sort Colors** (learn 3-pointer)
3. Practice **Kadane's Algorithm** (fundamental DP concept)
4. Master **Sliding Window** technique

### For Interview Prep:
- Each file contains:
  - ✅ Multiple approaches (brute force → optimal)
  - ✅ Detailed step-by-step explanations
  - ✅ Time & Space complexity analysis
  - ✅ Common mistakes and edge cases
  - ✅ Visual examples and dry runs

### Practice Strategy:
1. **First attempt**: Try solving without looking at solution (30 mins)
2. **Study solution**: Understand all approaches
3. **Implement again**: Write from scratch after 24 hours
4. **Teach it**: Explain to someone else or write down the approach

## 💡 Interview Tips

1. **Always discuss multiple approaches** - Start with brute force, then optimize
2. **State assumptions** - Ask about input constraints, duplicates, etc.
3. **Think aloud** - Interviewers want to see your thought process
4. **Test with examples** - Walk through your code with test cases
5. **Analyze complexity** - Always mention time and space complexity
