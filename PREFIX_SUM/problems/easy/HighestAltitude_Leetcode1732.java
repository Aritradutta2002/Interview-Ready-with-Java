/**
 * LeetCode 1732: Find the Highest Altitude
 * Difficulty: Easy
 * 
 * Problem:
 * There is a biker going on a road trip. The road trip consists of n + 1 points at different altitudes.
 * The biker starts his trip on point 0 with altitude equal to 0.
 * You are given an integer array gain of length n where gain[i] is the net gain in altitude between points i and i + 1.
 * Return the highest altitude of a point.
 * 
 * Key Insight:
 * This problem is a direct application of prefix sums. The altitude at each point is the sum of all gains up to that point, starting from an initial altitude of 0.
 * We can maintain a running sum (currentAltitude) and track the maximum value this sum reaches.
 *
 * Example:
 * Input: gain = [-5, 1, 5, 0, -7]
 * Altitudes:
 * - Start at 0
 * - Point 1: 0 + (-5) = -5
 * - Point 2: -5 + 1 = -4
 * - Point 3: -4 + 5 = 1
 * - Point 4: 1 + 0 = 1
 * - Point 5: 1 + (-7) = -6
 * The sequence of altitudes is [0, -5, -4, 1, 1, -6]. The highest altitude is 1.
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(n), as we iterate through the gain array once.
 * Space Complexity: O(1), as we only use a few variables to store the current and max altitudes.
