 * PAINTER'S PARTITION PROBLEM (Classic)
 * Difficulty: Medium-Hard
 * Pattern: Binary Search on Answer (Work Distribution)
 * 
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * PROBLEM STATEMENT:
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * 
 * You have to paint N boards of lengths {A1, A2, ... AN}. There are K painters 
 * available and each takes 1 unit time to paint 1 unit of board.
 * 
 * The problem is to find the minimum time to paint all boards under the constraints:
 * 1. Any painter will only paint continuous sections of boards (contiguous constraint)
 * 2. A painter can paint multiple boards but each board can be painted by only one painter
 * 3. All painters work simultaneously
 * 
 * Find the minimum time required to paint all boards.
 * 
 * EXAMPLE 1:
 * Input: boards = [10, 20, 30, 40], painters = 2
 * Output: 60
 * Explanation:
 * - Painter 1: [10, 20, 30] = 60 units
 * - Painter 2: [40] = 40 units
 * Time = max(60, 40) = 60
 * 
 * Other allocations:
 * - [10], [20, 30, 40] → max(10, 90) = 90
 * - [10, 20], [30, 40] → max(30, 70) = 70
 * - [10, 20, 30], [40] → max(60, 40) = 60 ✓ MINIMUM
 * 
 * EXAMPLE 2:
 * Input: boards = [10, 10, 10, 10], painters = 2
 * Output: 20
 * Explanation:
 * - Painter 1: [10, 10] = 20
 * - Painter 2: [10, 10] = 20
 * 
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM:
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * 
 * REAL-WORLD SCENARIO:
 * --------------------
 * Imagine K workers painting a fence divided into N sections:
 * - Each section takes different time to paint
 * - Workers work simultaneously
 * - Total time = time taken by slowest worker
 * - Goal: Minimize this maximum time
 * 
 * CONSTRAINT VISUALIZATION:
 * -------------------------
 * Boards: [10, 20, 30, 40]
 * 
 * Valid allocation (contiguous):
 * Painter 1: [10, 20]
 * Painter 2: [30, 40]
 * ✓
 * 
 * Invalid allocation (non-contiguous):
 * Painter 1: [10, 30]  ← Skipped board 20!
 * Painter 2: [20, 40]
 * ✗
 * 
 * WHY BINARY SEARCH?
 * ------------------
 * Problem type: "Minimize the maximum time"
 * 
 * Monotonic property:
 * - If we can finish painting with max time T
 * - Then we can definitely finish with max time T+1
 * - But maybe NOT with max time T-1
 * 
 * Visual:
 * Time:  20  30  40  50  60  70  80  90  100
 * Can do: ✗   ✗   ✗   ✗   ✓   ✓   ✓   ✓   ✓
 *                          ↑
 *                    Minimum time (answer!)
 * 
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * ALGORITHM:
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * 
 * Same as Book Allocation & Split Array!
 * 
 * 1. Binary search on answer (time)
 * 2. For each candidate time, check if K painters can finish
 * 3. Greedy validation: Give boards to painters until limit reached
 * 
 * DETAILED EXAMPLE:
 * -----------------
 * boards = [10, 20, 30, 40], painters = 2
 * 
 * Search space: [40, 100]
 * 
 * Try mid = 70:
 *   Painter 1: 10 + 20 + 30 = 60 (adding 40 would exceed 70)
 *   Painter 2: 40
 *   Used 2 painters ✓
 *   70 works, try smaller → right = 69
 * 
 * Try mid = 54:
 *   Painter 1: 10 + 20 = 30 (adding 30 would exceed 54)
 *   Painter 2: 30 (adding 40 would exceed 54)
 *   Painter 3: 40
 *   Used 3 painters ✗ Too many!
 *   54 too small → left = 55
 * 
 * Try mid = 60:
 *   Painter 1: 10 + 20 + 30 = 60
 *   Painter 2: 40
 *   Used 2 painters ✓
 *   60 works, try smaller → right = 59
 * 
 * Continue...
 * Answer: 60

 *    - Minimize maximum sum of any subarray

 * 
 * ALL USE SAME TEMPLATE:
 * ----------------------
 * 1. Binary search on answer: [max element, sum of elements]

/*
 * INTERVIEW TIPS:
 * ===============
 * 
 * 1. Recognize the pattern immediately:
 *    "Minimize maximum" + "contiguous allocation" = Binary Search on Answer
 * 
 * 2. Explain the template:
 *    - Define search space
 *    - Binary search on answer
 *    - Greedy validation
 * 
 * 3. Mention similar problems:
 *    Shows breadth of knowledge
 * 
 * 4. Discuss time complexity:
 *    O(n * log(sum - max))
 *    Usually acceptable for n up to 10^6
 * 
 * 5. Handle edge cases:
 *    - painters > boards
 *    - Single board
 *    - All boards same size
