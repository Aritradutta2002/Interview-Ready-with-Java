 * LINKED LIST PATTERNS - CP/Interview Theory
 *
 * Core patterns:
 * 1) Runner (Fast/Slow pointers): middle, cycle detection (Floyd), palindrome check
 * 2) In-place reversal: reverse entire list, reverse sublist, reverse in k-group
 * 3) Merge techniques: merge 2 lists, merge K lists (heap/divide&conquer)
 * 4) Pointer rewire: remove Nth from end, reorder list, partition list
 * 5) Sorting: merge sort on linked list (O(n log n), O(1) extra)
